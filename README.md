# About
EthicsInApps is an [MA7](https://www.wien.gv.at/kultur/abteilung/) funded project with the goal to state a declaration on ethics in smartphones' apps and operating systems.
The declaration shall serve as a checklist for implementors as well as form the basis for policy discussions on defining ethical behaviour in apps, smart phones and in a certain sense - our global data-surveillance- and tracking IT infrastructure.

While on the one hand, IT tech is super practical... _blablahblah_...
